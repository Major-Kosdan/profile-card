      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>I’m Kosisochukwu Daniel, a web developer who enjoys building clean and responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, and MySQL. I’ve also been learning WordPress and how to manage websites better. I love improving my skills and creating simple solutions that actually work.</p>

    <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
      <h2>Goals in this program</h2>
      <p>To grow my frontend development skills, work better in teams, meet deadlines effectively, and build real-world projects that follow best practices.</p>
    </section>

    <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
      <h2>Areas of low confidence</h2>
      <p>I’m still learning how to handle complex state and animations, but I’m improving every day. I take time to practice, try new things, and learn from my mistakes. Each project I work on teaches me something new, how to make designs smoother, user interactions better, and my code cleaner. I may not know it all yet, but I’m growing fast and enjoying every bit of the process.

      <p>Consistency is what truly makes the difference. I remind myself to stay curious, keep experimenting, and enjoy the process rather than rushing the results.
